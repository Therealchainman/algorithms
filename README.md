# Overview

This will be converted into a jupyter book. Every algorithm will have a dedicated folder and there may be multiple jupyter notebooks in each folder with variations of the algorithm. 

Algorithms will be implemented in python and C++ programming language.  In python for the simplicity and execution in jupyter notebooks and C++ for the faster runtime.
